# A lending/staking protocol

**How it works?**

First the user sends some eth to the contract and as per the eth sent, the person gets sent a "Staking token" which is a proof that he has some part in the protocol.

Every 2 weeks they get rewarded with a reward token.
For now the they cannot withdraw before 2 weeks because if they do they basically do not get any reward.


**All the function breakdown**
finish this :)


### TO Do for tommorow
1. ~~make a func to actually check the balance of the address to see if the ERC20 token is actually transfered. 
right now the functions transfers (according to the terminal testing interface atleast.)~~
2.  



Goodbye :)
