# A lending/staking protocol

**How it works?**

First the user sends some eth to the contract and as per the eth sent, the person gets sent a "Staking token" which is a proof that he has some part in the protocol.

Every 2 weeks they get rewarded with a reward token.
For now the they cannot withdraw before 2 weeks because if they do they basically do not get any reward.
